## Discussing Just the *Basics*:

Every time you switch locations in a screenplay, or at least when the camera will be shooting in a different location, you'll what to write it something like this:
>
>`INT. HOSPITAL - DAY`
>
This is the **scene heading**, and in this specific circumstance, we use `INT.` to say whether or not the scene is inside of something **(the interior)**, or rather using `EXT.`, the outside of something **(the exterior)**.

Then, what comes right after is the actual shot location, in this case being a `hospital`. One may also choose to add more specificities through additional hyphens, such as doing:
>
>`INT. HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA - DAY`
>
Now we know that the shot specifically takes place in the **cafeteria** of the **hospital**.

The last part of the title is the time of day. It can be as simple as saying `NIGHT` or `DAY`, but you may also decide to get more specific by saying `DAWN` or `EVENING`. You get the gist. 

*And remember to always ***CAPITALIZE*** these titles.*
