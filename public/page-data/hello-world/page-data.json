HOSPITAL - DAY</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the <strong>scene heading</strong>, and in this specific circumstance, we use <code class=\"language-text\">INT.</code> to say whether or not the scene is inside of something <strong>(the interior)</strong>, or rather using <code class=\"language-text\">EXT.</code>, the outside of something <strong>(the exterior)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Then, what comes right after is the actual shot location, in this case being a <code class=\"language-text\">hospital</code>. One may also choose to add more specificities through additional hyphens, such as doing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">INT.
